Overview
========

This workshop is an introduction to the [Julia][] programming language for
people familiar R, Python, or MATLAB. Compared to those languages, Julia code
typically runs orders of magnitude faster but has a similar level of
abstraction, so you can focus on your research problem rather than hardware
minutiae. Julia also provides out-of-the-box Unicode support, an easy-to-use
package manager, multithreading facilities, a macro system, and a rich type
system to optimize and prevent bugs in your code. Workshop topics include a
concise overview of Julia's syntax and features, an end-to-end introduction to
using built-in functions and contributed packages to read, summarize, and
visualize tabular data, and real-world examples where we've found Julia
beneficial.

This workshop was developed by the [UC Julia User Group][ucjug]. If you're a
Julia user at *any* UC campus, you're welcome to join! We meet virtually a few
times every term to discuss how we're using Julia and the latest Julia news, as
well as develop resources like this one.
