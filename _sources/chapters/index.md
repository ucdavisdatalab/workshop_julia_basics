Overview
========

This workshop is an introduction to the [Julia][] programming language for
people familiar R, Python, or MATLAB. Compared to those languages, Julia code
typically runs orders of magnitude faster but has a similar level of
abstraction, so you can focus on your research problem rather than hardware
minutiae. Julia also provides out-of-the-box Unicode support, an easy-to-use
package manager, multithreading facilities, a macro system, and a rich type
system to optimize and prevent bugs in your code. Workshop topics include a
concise overview of Julia's syntax and features, an end-to-end introduction to
using built-in functions and contributed packages to read, summarize, and
visualize tabular data, and real-world examples where we've found Julia
beneficial.

Learning Goals
--------------

After completing this workshop, learners should be able to:

* Explain the advantages and disadvantages of Julia compared to other
  programming languages
* Write Julia code that uses variables, control flow, functions, and other
  fundamental programming language features
* Describe Julia's type system and its purpose at a high-level
* Add type annotations to a Julia function
* Read tabular data into Julia
* Describe and use the [DataFrames.jl][] package
* Create visualizations with Julia's visualization packages
* Give examples of ways using Julia can benefit research
* List some references to learn more about Julia

[DataFrames.jl]: https://dataframes.juliadata.org/

Prerequisites
-------------

Participants must be proficient programming in a language such as R, Python, or
MATLAB. Before the workshop, participants must install the latest version of
[Julia][] on their computer.

<!--
No prior programming experience is necessary. Learners should commit to
attending all four sessions of this series.

These workshops are not an introduction to Python. Learners must have taken
[DataLab’s Python Basics workshop series][basics] or have equivalent prior
experience using Python.
